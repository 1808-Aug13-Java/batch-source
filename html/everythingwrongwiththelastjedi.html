        <li>Why would hux let poe keep trolling him instead of firing on him immediately?</li>
        <li>Why would you kill off snoke in episode 8 when he's the entire reason the first order came to power? Where was this guy the entire time during the original trilogy? </li>
        <li>Why would you fly the bombers so close to each other if they get destroyed at the touch of a feather?</li>

        <li>Why did Holdo sacrifice herself instead of using a droid or autopilot?</li>

        <li>Why would you park your spaceship on the beach if you can get arrested for that? Isn't that something you should be aware of if the fate of the resistance depends on you?</li>
        <li>why didn't maz just tell them the name of the hacker? Couldn't she just as easily have said his name instead of saying that she didn't have time to tell them his name and that he was wearing a lapel on his jacket? all she had to do was say 'And his name is...'</li>
        <li>Why did Poe think Luke was trying to cause a distraction? Wouldn't Luke have mentioned that to Leia if that was his plan?</li>

        <li>When did people start saying things like "godspeed" and "laser sword" in star wars?</li>
        <li>Why would you spend 40 minutes with the casino subplot when it ended up having no effect at the end anyway?</li>
        <li>Why did DJ seem like he wanted Rose's pendant for payment if he only needed it to hack the passcode?</li>
