		<p><b>Emperor: </b>Sheev Palpatine</p>
		<p><b>Homeworld: </b>Naboo</p>
		<p><b>Father: </b>Cosinga Palpatine</p>
		<p class="text-justify" >Emperor Sheev Palpatine was born on the planet Naboo. He was eager to get his homeplanet involved in galactic politics and was instramental in negotioating Naboo into the Galactic Republic.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">After a tragedy in which his family died during a hyperspace run, Sheev allied himself with the late Hugo-Denmask in order to assess the issue of corruption in the Galactic Senate - overwhelmed with greed.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">As a Senator to the Republic, he watched as his home-planet was invaded by the Trade Federation and, disgusted with then-Chancellor Valorum's inaction on the crisis and moved to succeed him.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">Upon assuming the Chancellorship, Palpatine then had to contend with the Seperatist Crisis, whose solution to Corruption was mass violence across the Galaxy, forcing the Republic to build the Grand Army of the Republic and engage in the bitter conflict known as the Clone Wars.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">At the hieght of the Clone Wars, the Jedi Order made their move to seize control of the galaxy. Surviving an assassination attempt by Jedi Mace Windu and rescued by Vader, the Chancellor pushed the Republic to restructure itself into the Galactic Empire - a secure solution to both the Seperatists and the corruption in the pre-Clone Wars era.</p>
