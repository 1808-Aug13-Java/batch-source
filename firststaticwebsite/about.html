                Hello! My name is Cindy, and this website will have lots of resources available to 
                visitors so they can get better at cooking. 
                <br>
                I bake, cook, and make pudding. My favorite things to cook are curry and other soups.
                <br>
                I really love eating ice cream though.
                <br><br>
                Here is a picture of what I look like:
