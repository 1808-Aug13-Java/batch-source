            Kith partners with the iconic Coca-Cola for the third time to release a fully rounded co-branded collection inspired by international unity. Building on the initial collection with Converse last year, four new denim Chuck 70s are introduced.
            Each model is crafted from premium frayed denim and features Coca-Cola embroidery in four different languages, including Chinese, English, French, and Russian. China is presented in yellow denim with red embroidery, USA in red denim with white embroidery, France in navy denim with asymmetrical red and white embroidery, and Russia in white denim with mismatched red and blue embroidery. All four styles are outfitted with off-white vulcanized soles with translucent green outsoles that nod to the classic glass Coca-Cola bottles, as well as bottlecap-shaped Velcro patches on the medial sides. Lastly, all pairs arrive in custom Kith x Coca-Cola x Converse packaging. Retail is $150.  The Kith x Coca-Cola x Converse 2018 Collection releases this Friday at all Kith shops and at 11AM EST on Kith.com.
