<p class="text-left text-primary">It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.</p>

<p class="text-right text-success">We'll make some happy little bushes here. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.</p>

<p class="text-justify text-info">Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun You need the dark in order to show the light. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>


<p class="text-nowrap text-warning">You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.</p>

<p class="text-danger">Let's get crazy. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Now then, let's play.</p>

<p class="bg-success">You can do anything your heart can imagine. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

<p class="bg-info">How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>

<p class="bg-danger">You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. Do an almighty painting with us. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.</p>

<p class="bg-primary">That's crazy. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>

<p class="bg-warning">All you have to learn here is how to have fun. There it is. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-8">Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-4">Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>
