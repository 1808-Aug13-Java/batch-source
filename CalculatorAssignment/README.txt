Create a calculator java application with which you can perform basic arithmetic operations

Use Spring AOP to create advice which will:
log in a separate file the method signature of each operation as it is executed
log the operation arithmetically as it is performed - include the result (obtained by the join point, not from repeating the operation)
E.g. if add(2, 3) is called, “2 + 3 = 5” is logged
prevent the division method from executing if division is attempted by 0 and log an error

Exercise should be completed by 5pm Thursday
