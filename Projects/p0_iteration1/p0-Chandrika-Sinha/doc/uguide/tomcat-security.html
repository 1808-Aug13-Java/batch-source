<h3>
<a NAME="why"></a>Why use a SecurityManager?</h3>
The Java SecurityManager is what allows a web browser to run an applet
in its own sandbox to prevent untrusted code from accessing files on the
local system, connecting to a host other than the one the applet was loaded
from, etc.
<p>In the same way the SecurityManager protects you from an untrusted applet
running in your browser, use of a SecurityManager while running Tomcat
can protect your server from trojan servlets, JSP's, JSP beans, and tag
libraries.&nbsp; Or even inadvertent mistakes.
<p>Imagine if someone who is authorized to publish JSP's on your site invadvertently
included the following in their JSP:
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;% System.exit(1); %></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><br>Every time that JSP was executed by Tomcat, Tomcat would exit.
<p>Using the Java SecurityManager is just one more line of defense a system
administrator can use to keep the server secure and reliable.
<h3>
<a NAME="requirements"></a>System Requirements</h3>
Use of the SecurityManager requires a JVM that supports JDK 1.2.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="precautions"></a>Precautions</h3>
Implementation of a SecurityManager in Tomcat has not been fully tested
to ensure the security of Tomcat.&nbsp; No special Permissions have been
created to prevent access to internal Tomcat classes by JSP's, web applications,
servlets, beans, or tag libraries. Make sure that you are satisfied with
your SecurityManager configuration before allowing untrusted users to publish
web applications, JSP's, servlets, beans, or tag libraries.
<p>Still, running with a SecurityManager is definitely better than running
without one.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="permissions"></a>Types of Permissions</h3>
Permission classes are used to define what Permissions a class loaded by
Tomcat will have.&nbsp; There are a number of Permission classes as part
of the JDK and you can even create your own Permission class for use in
your own web applications.
<p>This is just a short summary of the System SecurityManager Permission
classes applicable to Tomcat.&nbsp; Please refer to the JDK documentation
for more information on using the below Permissions.
<p><b>java.util.PropertyPermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls read/write access to JVM properties such
as java.home.
<p><b>java.lang.RuntimePermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls use of some System/Runtime functions like
exit() and exec().
<p><b>java.io.FilePermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls read/write/execute access to files and
directories.
<p><b>java.net.SocketPermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls use of network sockets.
<p><b>java.net.NetPermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls use of multicast network connections.
<p><b>java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls use of reflection to do class introspection.
<p><b>java.security.SecurityPermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controls access to Security methods.
<p><b>java.security.AllPermission</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows access to all permissions, just as if you
were running Tomcat without a SecurityManager.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="violation"></a>What happens when the SecurityManager detects a
Security violation?</h3>
The JVM will throw an AccessControlException or a SecurityException when
the SecurityManager detects a security policy violation.
