Various connector based on message passing. The request/response are encapsulated
in a MsgBuffer, and sent via a TcpConnector ( able to send/receive messages).

Right now MsgBuffer use a variation of AJP21 for marshaling, waiting for better
ideeas. 

Need a way to assemble the componentes at runtime ( what marshaling, etc).
