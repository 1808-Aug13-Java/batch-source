    <h2>Components</h2>

    <dl>

      <dt>ContextManager</dt>
      <dd>
    	<ul>
      	  <li>maintains a list of adapters</li>
      	  <li>is the entry point for adapters and any component that can generate 
	    a Request/Response and wants to use servlets.</li>
      	  <li>is the control point that handles callback calls and notifications.</li>
      	  <li>maintains a list of webapps that are configured in the system.</li>
    	</ul>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Request,Response</dt>
      <dd>Internal representations, containing various attributes associated with
    	the request during processing.
      </dd>

      <dt>Interceptors</dt>
      <dd> 
	Request processing involves several stages - parsing, matching using url
	patterns, authentication and authorization, calling the handler and various
 	callbacks before, after and during the handler. 
	An interceptor defines callbacks ( or hooks ) for one or several actions
	and is able to alter that function.
	In fact, most of the processing logic is implemented as interceptor 
	callbacks, in an event-based system.
      </dd>

      <dt>Context, Container</dt>
      <dd>
    	Container represents a group of URLs sharing common properties like handler,
    	security, normal properties. Context is a particular case that is associated
    	with a web application and keeps all the properties defined in the spec. 
    	We are slowly moving toward use of Container, it can also represent group
    	of contexts, virtual hosts, etc. 
    	It is not a good idea to introduce sub-classes for every type of group, 
    	the isA property is not allways clearly cut. 
      </dd>
      
      <dt>ServletWrapper</dt>
      <dd>
    	A normal servlet or JSP, plus all the surounding logic.
      </dd>
      
      
      <dt>Facades</dt>
      <dd>For every object exposed in the servlet specification tomcat use a 
    	Facade. It have few important advantages:
    	<ul>
	  <li>Security - the user should have no way to access the real implementation
	    objects, except one controled way ( HttpRequestFacade.getRealRequest() ).
	    When policy-based security will be added that will allow the user to declare a 
	    "trusted" servlet, and no other servlet will be able to access internal objects.</li>
	  <li>Future evolution of Servlet API - the API changed and will probably change, 
	    by adding new methods and new semantics. Facades makes very simple to make sure
	    we respect the spec, without having to change the core too much.
	    That may allow supporting multiple servlet API versions ( but it's not a goal -
	    each context has it's own classloader and it may be possible to load a different
	    JDK and set of facades ).</li>
	  <li>Decouple the API and the web server. Tomcat.core allows integration with
	    web servers, and it's  modeled after APIs like Apache's, ISAPI and NSAPI.</li>
    	</ul>
    	
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>    
    
    <p>Required steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Find if the request needs authorization. </li>
      <li>Check if the request have the right credentials - if not generate 401  unauthorized.
      </li>
      <li>The normal error processing takes place: we can register special 401 error handler 
	that will implement the desired auth method
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The model we used is JAAS - the authenticator is a separate module that will 
      find if enough credentials are available. We use a "normal" tomcat module to "glue"
      between an auth API ( like JAAS or memoryRealm or catalina Realm if needed ) and 
      tomcat's internal representation of request. ( no "callbacks" yet - just static util
      functions to extract credentials from request. )
    </p>
      
    <p>We provide a simple implementation for standalone tomcat.: 
      <ul>
	<li>AccessInterceptor will match the security contraints and set a note "required.roles"
	  containing the list of valid groups.</li>
	<li>SimpleRealm will authorize the request against in-memory users. </li>
	<li>BasicLoginServlet, FormLoginServlet - implement the authentication protocol.
      </ul>
    </p>
    

    <p>In "production" mode we expect tomcat to be integrated with various systems. 
      Most web servers are using a similar mechanism - as long as the server is handling
      the static files we need to let him deal with authorization/authentication. 
      The only special case is Form based login, where the connector should forward
      the request to tomcat. ( no complete implementation yet ).
