        <h3>Where did we start?</h3>
        <p>The idea for food spotters stems from a project I did back in university where the goal was using php, css and html to create a website
            that aimed to deliver information from a database through a website. It was a nifty idea that instilled nostalgia, so I decided
            to use it as a theme for this assignment.
            <br>
            And while this assignment does not use DBMS it still held a certain familiarity that made me want to go forward with it.
