Practice with Components:

1. Highlight Component
Create a component which has some filler text - the background of the text should change to the color of your choice when you hover over the text

2. Profile Component
Create a component that displays user information - populated from a user object in its class
Create a button which toggles the visibility of this information. Button text should also toggle between saying “hide” and “show”

3. Select Component
Create a component with three radio buttons: one labeled “animals,” the next labeled “colors,” and the last labeled “days”  
When selected, a list (generated from arrays in the class) will be displayed containing a few animals, colors, or days respectively

4. Table Component:
Create a component which dynamically creates a table of people with name email and birthday
The table should pull from an array of people objects with fields: first name, last name, email, and birthday and should display full name, email and birthday
Use a pipe to capitalize their first and last name, and to specify a date format
Include a button in the component which toggles between an unformatted HTML table and a nicely formatted bootstrap table

5. User Component:
Create a component which makes an API call to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and populates the page with the fake users 

6. Nav Component
Create a component which allows you to easily navigate through components 1-5 (this will require making some routes)
