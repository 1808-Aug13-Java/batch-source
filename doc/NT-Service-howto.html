<h1>Working with the Jakarta NT Service</h1>

<p>By Gal Shachor

<p>The Jakarta NT service is an executable that wraps the
Tomcat servlet container and executes it in the background as an NT service. To
install it you will need to:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Get a
     hold on the NT executable (jk_nt_service.exe)</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Download
      the executable from the win32/i386 directory  found where you downloaded the
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/downloads/binindex.html"> Tomcat binary
      distribution.</a> For those using Netscape as your browser, try downloading
      a zip version of the file, if available. There can be problems using Netscape
      to download DLL files.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Customize
     a properties file that provides the service with Tomcat information
     (wrapper.properties).</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Locate the wrapper.properties template file in your Tomcat conf directory.
  <li>Update
      the wrapper.tomcat_home property to point at your tomcat home.</li>
  <li>Update
      the wrapper.java_home property to point at your Java home.</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Install
     jk_nt_service by running it with the -i flag.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Execute
      jk_nt_service -I &lt;name of service&gt; &lt;path to updated wrapper
      properties&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;name
      of service&gt; should be a single word (without and spaces) such as
      Jakarta</li>
  <li>&lt;path
      to updated wrapper properties&gt; should point to your wrapper.properties
      file (and the service will check it's existence.)</li>
  <li>For
      example, a valid command line can be jk_nt_service -I Jakarta wrapper.properties</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Start
     tomcat as a service.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>From
      the command line, execute net start &lt;name of service&gt; (e.g. net
      start Jakarta)</li>
  <li>From
      the NT services applet, highlight your service and press start.</li>
 </ul>
 <b>Note:</b> If the log file location in your wrapper.properties file points to
 the <tt>logs</tt> directory, and the <tt>logs</tt> directory doesn't yet exist,
 manually create it before starting the service.
 <li>Stop
     Tomcat as a service.</li>
 <ul>
  <li>From
      the command line, execute net stop &lt;name of service&gt; (e.g. net
      stop Jakarta)</li>
  <li>From
      the NT services applet, highlight your service and press stop.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p><b>Special note</b>: The Tomcat service is using AJPV12 to
perform clean shutdown and you should make sure that an AJPV12 connector is
defined in your server.xml. In the absence of a configured AJPV12 port the
Tomcat service will kill Tomcat abruptly (that is murder it) without giving it
a chance to clean up. </p>

<p><strong>Notice for JDK 1.3 users</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a 
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4323062.html">known problem</a>
in JDK 1.3 that affects Java applications being run as Windows NT services.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bug causes the
service to terminate when the currently logged in user logs out.&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest way to work
around this problem is to use JDK 1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your application requires JDK 1.3 features then you 
may want to look into <a href="http://www.kcmultimedia.com/javaserv/">javaserv</a> or
<a href="http://www.alexandriasc.com/software/JavaService/">JavaService</a>.&nbsp;&nbspUsers have reported
success with both of these packages but there may be others that work as well.
</p>
<p>To remove the installed service, execute jk_nt_service -R &lt;name of service&gt;</p>

<h1>Advance Setup</h1>

<ol>
 <li>Modify
     the Tomcat NT service properties. By default the service will run in manual
     mode and under the local system user account. To modify this, open the NT
     services applet, highlight your service and press startup. A popup window
     is opened and you will be able to customize the service to your
     satisfaction.</li>
 <li>Modify
     the classpath. The classpath is determined by the wrapper.class_path
     properties, to modify it just add/remove/modify wrapper.class_path lines.
     The complete classpath is calculated by concatenating all the
     wrapper.class_path lines and putting &quot;;&quot; between them.</li>
 <li>Execute
     several Tomcat instances. Say that you want one Tomcat to run for
     &quot;production&quot; and one for development, you can do that. All you
     will need to do is to install the Tomcat service twice and under two
     different names (and with different wrapper.properties file and server.xml
     files). </li>
 <ul>
  <li>Make
      sure that the AJPV12 and HTTP connectors are modified in each server.xml
      file to prevent a clash.</li>
  <li>Make
      sure to update the wrapper.shutdown_port property in wrapper.properties
      to point to the correct AJPV12 shutdown ports (default is 8007). </li>
 </ul>
 <li>Modify
     the command line used to start Tomcat. The Tomcat service is taking all
     it's command line configuration from wrapper.properties! To customize the
     command line, edit the property wrapper.cmd_line and make sure that it
     makes a legal Java command line.</li>
</ol>
