        <p>Once there was a land that lived in fear of seven goblins.</p>
        <p>They were called the Rainbow Goblins and each had his own color which was also his name!</p>
        <p>Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. Yellow being the craftiest was their chief.</p>
        <p>The goblins lived on color, they prowled the valleys and climbed the highest mountains looking for rainbows!</p>
        <p>And when they found one, they caught it in their lassos, sucked the colors out of it and filled their bellies with the bright liquid
