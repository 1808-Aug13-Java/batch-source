      <h1>Sections, Divs, and Article</h1>
      <p>While there is no functional difference between section and div elements, 
        there is a semantic one. The semantic value of section is: "hey, these 
        child elements are related by a common theme." Divs have no semantic value. Instead 
        they're incredibly generic and meant to be used if no other tags exist
         for what you're trying 
        to represent and need to style that item.

        The article tag, according to MDN is: " self-contained composition in a document, page, 
        application, or site, which is intended to be 
        independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). 
        Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry."

        Another great example would be this document. You'll notice I'm using articles for posts.
