              <h3>Super Smash Bros</h3>

              <p>Super Smash Bros is a old game that a lot of people still play. What makes this game so enjoyable for everyone 
                  is that the characters are all iconic and everyone knows who they are. Most people are familiar with Mario
                  and the characters in his game. This game series has multiple games that are still played at a competitive
                  level. The games that are currently in the series are Smash 64, Melee, Brawl, and Smash 4 Wii U. There will
                  be a brand new game in the series at the end of this year. Many people are looking forward to it.
