              <h3>StarCraft</h3>

              <p>
                  StarCraft, a game developed by Blizzard Entertainment, is a real time strategy game that primarily is popular
                  in South Korea. There are two main Starcraft games that are played competitively. There is StarCraft 2 and 
                  StarCraft Brood War. Brood War is widely considered one of the most balanced ESPORTS and requires a lot of
                  skill to play. It also shows its strength as an ESPORT as it is still being played 20 years later. It had 
                  also recieved an HD remaster that improved its graphics but still kept all the game mechanics the same.
