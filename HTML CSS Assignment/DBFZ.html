            <h3>Dragon Ball FighterZ</h3>

            <p>Dragon Ball FighterZ came out in the beginning of 2018. It has been a big hit and has started its own world tour.
                The creators have recognized how well it is doing and how competitive the game can be. It is great to see that this
                game continues to see support from its creator. It is a success in terms of ESPORTS, as it yielded some of the most
                competitors during EVO 2018.
